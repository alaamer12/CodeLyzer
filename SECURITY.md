# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The CodeLyzer team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in CodeLyzer, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly.
2. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.

Instead, please email us at **security@example.com** with the following details:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if applicable)
- Any proof of concept code, screenshots, or other supporting information
- Your name and contact information (if you wish to be credited for the discovery)

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report, you can expect the following:

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- We will provide a preliminary analysis of the report within 7 days.
- We will keep you informed of our progress as we address the issue.
- Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will notify you and discuss appropriate disclosure.

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.
- We will work with you to understand and address the issue before any public disclosure.
- We generally aim to resolve reported vulnerabilities within 90 days.
- We will credit you in the security advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:

- Patch releases (e.g., 1.0.x) for security fixes that don't change functionality
- Minor releases (e.g., 1.x.0) for more significant security changes

We strongly encourage all users to keep their installations of CodeLyzer up to date.

## Dependency Security

We actively monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

1. We use automated tools (Dependabot, Snyk) to track vulnerabilities in our dependencies.
2. We perform regular security audits of our dependency tree.
3. We aim to update vulnerable dependencies promptly.

## Security Best Practices

When using CodeLyzer:

1. Always use the latest version available.
2. Be cautious when analyzing untrusted codebases, as hostile code could potentially exploit parsing vulnerabilities.
3. Review the permissions you grant to any HTML reports generated by the tool before sharing them.

## Previous Vulnerabilities

Any previously disclosed vulnerabilities will be listed here with links to advisories.
