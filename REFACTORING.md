# CodeLyzer Refactoring

## Overview
This refactoring focused on improving the architecture of the CodeLyzer project to adhere to the Open-Closed Principle (OCP). The metrics collection and analysis system has been redesigned to be more extensible, modular, and maintainable.

## Key Changes

### Configuration Restructuring
- Created a hierarchical metrics structure with base classes and specialized metric categories
- Introduced proper separation of concerns between different metric types
- Added support for custom metrics via extension points

### Metric Provider Architecture
- Implemented the `MetricProvider` interface for various analyzers
- Created concrete analyzer implementations:
  - `SecurityAnalyzer` for detecting security vulnerabilities
  - `ComplexityAnalyzer` for calculating code complexity
  - `CodeSmellAnalyzer` for detecting code smells
  - `PatternBasedAnalyzer` for identifying design patterns

### Open-Closed Principle Implementation
- Base `ASTAnalyzer` now supports pluggable metric providers
- New analyzers can be added without modifying existing code
- Metric categories are extensible through custom metrics

### Property-Based Access
- Added property-based access to maintain backward compatibility
- Improved encapsulation of internal data structures

## Benefits

1. **Extensibility**: New analyzers can be added by simply implementing the `MetricProvider` interface
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each analyzer focuses on a specific aspect of code quality
3. **Maintainability**: Better organization of code with clear responsibilities
4. **Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility through property-based access
5. **Configurability**: Easy to customize and configure the system for different project needs

## Future Improvements

1. Add more specialized analyzers for different aspects of code quality
2. Improve detection algorithms within existing analyzers
3. Add configuration options for customizing analysis thresholds
4. Implement a plugin system for third-party analyzers
